# Table Data Viewer

This is a small app built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. The app displays a table with data and allows users to search through the data.

## Features:

- View tabular data.
- Search data using an input field.
- Uses React for the frontend and TypeScript for type safety.
- Vite is used for fast development and bundling.
- The Vite server is configured to run on port 3000 for API compatibility.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running locally, follow these steps:

After you download the project:

- Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. You can check by running `node -v` in your terminal.
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-directory>`
- Install the dependencies: `npm install`
- Start the development server: `npm run dev`

Thatâ€™s it! You can now open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app running.

## Vite Configuration

The app uses **Vite** as the bundler. The Vite config has been modified to run on port 3000 to ensure compatibility with the API.

If you need to modify the port or other configurations, you can do so in the `vite.config.ts` file.

## Built With:

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
